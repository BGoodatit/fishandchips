ðŸŒŠ Thank you for contributing to Tide! ðŸŒŠ

## Code Conventions

### Style Guide

- `test` > `[...]`
- `printf` > `echo`
- `&&`/`||` > `and`/`or`
- Conditionals
  - For simple conditionals use `&&`/`||`
    - Ex: `test -n "$foo" && echo "foo is not empty"`
    - Ex: `foo || bar || baz`
  - For anything more complex use `if`, `else`, and `else if`
- Long forms of flags > short forms
  - Exceptions: `set`, `set_color`, `function foo -a`, "common knowledge" options for commands like `rm -r`
  - Note that MacOS utils often do not support long flags, in which case one should use the short option
- Piping > command substitution (only when convenient, i.e no extra commands)

### Naming Conventions

Local variables should be named in `camelCase`.

- `set -l numberOfNewlines`

Anything exposed to the shell or user--functions, global/universal variables, and files--should be named in `snake_case`, beginning with `tide_`. Prepend an underscore if the user in not meant to interact directly with it.

- `set -g _tide_left_prompt_height`
- `set -U tide_right_prompt_items`
- `_tide_count_left_prompt_height.fish`
- `_tide_right_prompt`

#### Specific Naming Conventions

- Items begin with `_tide_item_`
- Subcommands begin with `_tide_sub_`
